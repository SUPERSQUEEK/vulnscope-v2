"""
Findings and severity.

A finding is one conclusion about one target, with the evidence that produced
it kept attached. Severity uses a small, named scale rather than a raw CVSS
number, because a scanner that reports "6.8" invites false precision - the
inputs to a real CVSS vector (exploitability, privileges required, user
interaction) are things a unauthenticated scanner cannot observe, so inventing
the score would be dishonest. The scale below says what the tool can actually
justify from what it saw.
