"""
Fail-closed scope enforcement.

The single most important line in a scanning tool is the one that decides
whether a target is allowed to be touched. ReconScope enforced scope twice -
when a job was scheduled and again immediately before each packet - because a
scope check that runs once can be defeated by DNS rebinding, redirects, or a
hostname that resolves somewhere new between the check and the connection.

The engine calls guard() once per target, then pins every connection to its
vetted address. guard() denies by default: a target is refused unless it
matches an explicit allow rule AND matches no deny rule. There is no "allow
everything" setting, on purpose.
